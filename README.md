# BlockCarbon Market
Development of hybrid market place technology for Cardano carbon credit tokenization.

We take a look at best practise industry carbon registry, token minting policy and retirement contracts and adjust them for the UTxO model and its advantages. Meant for discussion of progressive elements and testnet implementation as well as Python or Typescript deployment like [Opshin](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin), [MeshJS](https://meshjs.dev/).

## BlockCarbon Introduction
The uncontrolled emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere has led to disastrous consequences, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the loss of biodiversity. The urgent need to mitigate climate change has resulted in the development of various carbon offset programs that allow individuals and organizations to compensate for their carbon emissions by supporting projects that reduce GHG emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, existing carbon offset programs often lack transparency, accountability, and traceability. The traditional carbon offset market is rife with inefficiencies, opaque processes, and centralized intermediaries. BlockCarbon is responding to the urgent need for a decentralized, transparent, and secure solution for carbon offsets and investable carbon.

To fight climate change, government taxation and consumer awareness are not enough. We need a paradigm shift in financial markets and industry to rapidly incentivize emission-reducing innovation, the use of low emission fuels and carbon sinks such as reforestation on a huge scale. Currently, government emissions trading schemes and a voluntary carbon market for enterprise try to achieve this, but are plagued by a myriad of problems causing market fragmentation and lack of adoption. Through tokenization, blockchain can fix these issues. Unlike legacy registries, the nature of blockchain validation ensures immutable and verifiable record keeping, Common problems of carbon accounting, like questionable additionality of offsets, leakage of emission mitigation into other jurisdictions or double counting will be much easier to address. BlockCarbon aim to create best practises for trustless global carbon tokenization. Along with building a datebase of all known projects, methods and research, we can build an alternative to limited national schemes and low-quality “green washing” offsets of the corporate sector.

The BlockCarbon Suite is a revolutionary blockchain-based solution that aims to address the pressing issue of carbon offset in a decentralized and transparent manner. Inspired by the principles of decentralization, transparency, and cryptographic security, BlockCarbon leverages blockchain technology to enable individuals and organizations to offset their carbon emissions by allowing tokenization of carbon credits.

## Bridging Legacy Carbon and Web3

Another technical problem, albeit much smaller in scale, is exclusive to blockchain solutions: Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts. The use of blockchain technology for tracking and trading carbon credits has gained momentum in recent years, with the promise of increased transparency, security, and efficiency. However, like any technology, blockchain is not immune to vulnerabilities, and smart contracts - self-executing code that governs transactions on the blockchain - can be susceptible to risks that could potentially jeopardize the integrity and credibility of carbon credits.

Some key vulnerabilities in smart contracts that could pose risks to carbon credits on the blockchain:
Coding errors and vulnerabilities: Smart contracts are written in code, and like any software, they can contain coding errors or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. For example, a coding error could result in incorrect calculations of carbon credits, allowing for the creation of fake credits or manipulation of existing credits. Similarly, vulnerabilities in the code could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the smart contract, allowing for unauthorized transfers or modifications of carbon credits.

Oracle manipulation: Smart contracts often rely on external data sources, known as oracles, to obtain information such as carbon emission data or verification of emission reduction projects. However, these oracles can be manipulated or compromised, leading to inaccurate or fraudulent data being fed into the smart contract. This could result in the issuance of invalid carbon credits or the manipulation of carbon credit transactions, undermining the integrity of the system.

Governance and consensus vulnerabilities: Blockchain networks are typically governed by consensus mechanisms, where multiple participants must agree on the validity of transactions and smart contract updates. However, vulnerabilities in the consensus mechanism or the governance process could be exploited to gain control over the network and manipulate carbon credit transactions. For example, a malicious actor could launch a 51% attack, where they gain control of the majority of the network's computing power, allowing them to manipulate transactions and potentially create fake carbon credits.
Legal and regulatory risks: Carbon credits are subject to a complex web of legal and regulatory requirements, including international standards and guidelines. Smart contracts on the blockchain may not fully comply with these requirements, posing legal and regulatory risks. For example, the lack of proper verification and certification processes in  a smart contract could result in the issuance of invalid carbon credits, leading to legal disputes or regulatory penalties. 

Human error and insider threats: Human error or insider threats can also pose risks to smart contracts and carbon credits on the blockchain. For example, a user with access to the smart contract's private keys could mistakenly make incorrect transactions or intentionally manipulate carbon credit transactions for personal gain. 

Mitigating Risks to Carbon Credits on the Blockchain: To mitigate the risks associated with vulnerabilities in smart contracts and safeguard the integrity of carbon credits on the blockchain, several measures can be taken:
Code audits and best practices: Conduct thorough code audits of smart contracts by experienced and qualified professionals to identify and address coding errors or vulnerabilities. Follow best practices for smart contract development, such as using well- tested libraries, adhering to coding standards, and conducting extensive testing.

Robust oracle mechanisms: Implement robust oracle mechanisms that rely on multiple trusted data sources and ensure that data inputs into the smart contract are verified and validated to prevent oracle manipulation.
Strong governance and consensus mechanisms: Implement robust governance and consensus mechanisms in the blockchain network to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of smart contracts. Regularly review and update the governance processes to adapt to changing threats and technologies.

Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements: Ensure that the smart contract and the blockchain-based carbon credit system comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including international standards and guidelines. This may involve obtaining third-party certifications or audits to ensure compliance.

Access controls and user education: Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access to smart contracts and conduct regular user education and training to prevent

The Leakage Effect: How High Carbon Prices or Taxes Can Lead to Emissions Leakage Carbon pricing mechanisms, such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, are often implemented as policy tools to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigate climate change. However, one potential unintended consequence of high carbon prices or taxes is the phenomenon known as "emissions leakage," which refers to the relocation of emissions from one jurisdiction or sector to another, resulting in a net increase in global emissions. The leakage effect can occur due to several reasons:

Carbon leakage: When a jurisdiction or country imposes a high carbon price or tax on certain industries, such as energy-intensive manufacturing or fossil fuel production, it may lead to increased production costs. As a result, businesses may choose to relocate their operations to jurisdictions with lower or no carbon pricing, where they can produce goods or services at a lower cost. This can result in the shifting of emissions from the higher- priced jurisdiction to the lower-priced jurisdiction, leading to carbon leakage. In essence, the emissions are not reduced, but rather displaced to another jurisdiction, resulting in a global increase in emissions.

Market-based leakage: In the case of cap-and-trade systems, where emissions allowances are bought and sold in a market, high carbon prices can also result in market- based leakage. If the cost of buying allowances becomes too high for certain industries or sectors, they may choose to reduce their production or operations, resulting in lower demand for allowances. This can lead to a surplus of allowances in the market, which can be purchased by other industries or sectors at a lower cost. As a result, emissions may be shifted from the higher-priced sectors to the lower-priced sectors, leading to emissions leakage. 

Regulatory arbitrage: In some cases, high carbon prices or taxes in one jurisdiction may incentivize businesses to relocate their operations to jurisdictions with weaker or no carbon pricing regulations. This can be referred to as regulatory arbitrage, where businesses exploit regulatory differences between jurisdictions to minimize their carbon costs. For example, a business may choose to move its production to a jurisdiction with less stringent carbon pricing regulations, where it can emit more without incurring higher costs, resulting in emissions leakage. 

The leakage effect can have implications for global emissions reduction efforts, as it can undermine the effectiveness of carbon pricing mechanisms in achieving their intended goals. If emissions are simply shifted from one jurisdiction or sector to another, without actual emissions reductions, it can result in a net increase in global emissions, defeating the purpose of carbon pricing as a climate mitigation tool. 

To mitigate the risk of emissions leakage, policymakers need to carefully consider the design and implementation of carbon pricing mechanisms. This includes taking into account the competitiveness of industries, potential impacts on trade, and coordination with other jurisdictions or sectors. Measures such as border carbon adjustments, which impose carbon charges on imports from jurisdictions with weaker climate policies, can help prevent emissions leakage and level the playing field for businesses. Additionally, using the revenue generated from carbon pricing to invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and innovation can create incentives for businesses to transition to low-carbon technologies and practices, reducing the need for emissions leakage. 

In conclusion, high carbon prices or taxes can potentially lead to emissions leakage, where emissions are shifted from one jurisdiction or sector to another, resulting in a net increase in global emissions. Policymakers need to carefully consider the design and implementation of carbon pricing mechanisms to mitigate the risk of emissions leakage and ensure that emissions reduction efforts are effective in mitigating climate change.

Initial minting for verified projects

Burning during retirement 

Emergency freeze capability 

Integrates with the registry validator by:
   
Verifying project status before minting 
Checking quantities against registry records 
Maintaining registry owner control 

Implements key differences from the Solidity version: 
Uses Cardano native tokens instead of ERC20 
Implements direct burning rather than status flags 
Leverages UTxO model for balance tracking

Retirement validator that:

Implements a two-step retirement process:

1. Initial retirement creation with token burning 
        
2. Confirmation with permanent transaction record 
        
Stores comprehensive retirement data: 
    
* Beneficiary information        
* Retirement details and messages       
* Project references 
* Immutable proof of retirement 
        
Provides safety mechanisms:

### Getting started with MeshJS
To get started with Mesh, you need to install the latest version of Mesh with npm:

~~~
npm install @meshsdk/core @meshsdk/react
~~~

Below is an alternative deploy.js script written in TypeScript-compatible JavaScript. This script uses ethers.js for deploying the Solidity contract and an example command to deploy the universal smart contract.
Install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install ethers @types/node`

Use the deploy.ts script:


Usage
To run this script, use ts-node, which allows you to execute TypeScript files directly. First, install ts-node if you haven't already:


`npm install -g ts-node`


`Run the script with:`


`ts-node deploy.ts [aiken]`


Replace [aiken] with other language depending on which contract you want to deploy.

This script reads, compiles, and deploys the smart contract using ethers.js and executes a command to deploy the Move contract using the CLI tool. Adjust the off-chain deployment command as necessary for your specific environment and setup.
