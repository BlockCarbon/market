# Anastasia Labs - Lucid Evolution: Redefining Off-Chain Transactions in Cardano

Project goal is to ensure long-term clarity by consistent maintenance, address GitHub issues, create new pull requests, and upgrade Lucid to the latest CML versions for sustained effectiveness.

This project introduces Lucid to **Blockcarbon Market** which used to be the go-to solution for JS/TS off-chain deployment, but continuity and maintenance of the project used to be an issue and we have primarily made us of MeshJS instead because of this. This project "fixes" this.

It is also unique in the depth it deals with [SanchoNet](https://sancho.network/) and Volatire features that will fully introduce liquid democracy after the Plomin Hard Fork end of January 2025.

[Updated/Enhanced Lucid Documentation](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/lucid-evolution/blob/main/README.md)
Identification of Missing Functions: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Lucid framework to identify gaps in utility and convenience functions that hinder efficient development.]
Function Design: Develop a design proposal outlining the new utility functions to be implemented, with a focus on simplifying common design patterns, such as passing indices in the transaction redeemer.
Implementation: Code and integrate the proposed utility functions into the Lucid framework to streamline tasks like sorting inputs by TxOutRef's, indexing, and balancing.
Testing Suite: Develop a robust testing suite to ensure the functionality, correctness, and efficiency of the newly implemented utility functions.
