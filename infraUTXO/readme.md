`Data-driven predictions can succeed - and they can fail. It is when we deny our role in the process that the odds of failure rise. Before we demand more of our data, we need to demand more of ourselves.` _Nate Silver_

Project Catalyst has a high level of transparency, and most data is available on the website, or through Google Drive links. There is no single place with all the data though, and fund-specific categories or scoring, validation fields etc. make it hard to aggregate. That's why we've done the job for you and hopefully you will either find the data or the reports you like to see contained in this repository. If not, please contact us!
