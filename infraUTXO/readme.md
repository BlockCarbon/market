## Structure

We have considered a large body of work from previously funded teams on Project Catalyst, plus open source contributions from DEXes and popular protocols on Cardano. Most work that was created prior to Aiken language and the Vasil hard fork have been ruled out as the code is too difficult to port and does not represent significant efficiency improvements or costs savings versus creating from scratch, bearing in mind the unique characteristics of carbon tokenization like retirement and adjustment mechanisms.
