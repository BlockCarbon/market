Re-engineering our AMM decentralized exchange's smart contracts from Plutus to Aiken.

* Demonstrates Aiken's Practicality: We will provide a clear, tangible demonstration of Aiken's capabilities by transforming an existing, successful DEX. This will serve as a powerful proof of concept for Aiken's utility in the Cardano ecosystem.
* Sharing Knowledge and Experience: Throughout the process, we will document our journey, capturing insights, challenges, and breakthroughs. This knowledge will be invaluable to the Cardano development community as they consider adopting Aiken for their own projects.
* Foster Aiken's Growth: Our hands-on use of Aiken will provide critical feedback to its developers. This real-world testing and feedback will help inform Aiken's future development, ensuring it meets the practical needs of Cardano DApp developers.
* Drive Innovation: Our project will stimulate further interest and innovation in the Cardano ecosystem by showcasing Aiken's unique features and strengths. This will help maintain Cardano's position at the cutting edge of blockchain technology.

By translating Sundaeswap's smart contracts into Aiken, Sundae Labs is enhancing its own product and also actively contributing to the development and maturity of the Cardano ecosystem.
