NMKR Studio is partially open-sourced and will be "further open sourced in the future". This makes the usability of the code inside **Blockcarbon Market** Difficult, but the project offers valuable insights into RWA token minting on Cardano.

The team offer valuable information about token issuance, token registry and also provide one-stop services to conveniently mint tokens without access to a Cardano node or CLI. Their [Github page](https://github.com/nftmakerio) offers other partially open sourced code as well.
