# Sundae Labs Automated Price Discovery

Cardano-based decentralized platform for automated price discovery, enabling DAOs to conduct token sales with less volatility and improved liquidity.

While this is DAO tooling proposed in a dedicated Project Catalyst challenge for DAOs, the automated price discovery is highly useful for the **Blockcarbon Market** use as a hybrid market place and exchange, where a DAO-like organization between registry, minting projects, token holders and retirement or adjustment smart contracts may exist at the production stage.

Includes Liquidity Bootstrapping Events (LBEs) for Clarity and REIT, achieving the intended goals of fair and transparent price discovery while generating significant liquidity. The final report contains specific data on platform performance, liquidity trends, price stability, and user feedback gathered during these events, as requested in the feedback we received.

Platform Performance: API response times, liquidity data, and usage metrics are thoroughly detailed in the report.
Price Stability and Liquidity: Charts and data visualizations are provided in the report to showcase the price and liquidity trends during the LBEs, highlighting the effectiveness of the "Taste Test" platform.
The project's success is evidenced by the completion of two LBEs, the lessons learned, and the refinements implemented.

The automated price discovery process is designed to happen before, or shortly after the token launch of a new project. It allows a diverse set of market participants to participate in the injection of a large amount of liquidity into a project token, collaboratively arriving at a shared price for all participants, absorbing risk and initial volatility of a new token. By doing this, it helps investors make more informed decisions, increasing their confidence in their investments.

For DAOs and project owners, the platform aims to provide maximum liquidity and dampen volatility at launch. By estimating and communicating the launch token value effectively, it can help attract more investors, thus generating more liquidity. This not only helps in the project's initial phases but also contributes to its long-term sustainability by fostering a stable investment environment.

Additionally, the platform serves as an endorsement of project quality for Cardano's chain stakeholders. The use of the automated price discovery system can be seen as a measure of a project's commitment to transparency and investor protection, and hence, increases its credibility.

Over time, as more projects use this system, the Cardano ecosystem can become more vibrant and trusted, populated with high-quality projects and characterized by healthy liquidity. This will benefit everyone in the ecosystem, from individual market participants to DAOs and project owners to the wider Cardano community.

The smart contracts for this product have already been written, so the bulk of the funding and effort described in this proposal will involve the productization and build-out of the service offering around those contracts.
